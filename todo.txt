### IMPORTANT ###

- fix "what to do" shutdown msg (resource_store.c)

- add render world and draw_world or sumth

- stop using strings, keep only hashes!

- remove union from Resource (just do void* + cast? perhaps with type enum or macro that takes type and does cast etc)

### LESS IMPORTANT ###

- magical central place where handle pools are registered with names and stuff and then we can give it a handle and it will tell us type and subtype information (with string names!!) from it. wow such types

- tidy up array.h (look at nothings impl), think about name again 

- put renderer on own thread

- alpha support (something else than VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR)

- rewrite obj loader, its ugly

- make first-person flying camera (see avatar.lua)

- combine linux_main and linux_xcb_window into main_linux_xcb_vulkan

- make renderer askable about source type, i.e. have shader_default_fragment as source string, and append whatever renderer tells us to do... or maybe just have a source_spirv field and ask renderer which field to pull, like with a SHADER_LANGAUGE_TYPE enum in the renderer

- in shader in parser, error if > 1 shader of a type

- add library shader compiler or invoke commandline shader compiler (so we can use glsl)

- make resource that is compiled into just a struct and then loaded quickly (data compiler)

- array: make array_internal_ensure_min_size func use array_internal_grow with capacity parameter! i.e. grow will then make it at least as big as the supplied value, maybe bigger (geometric growth)
