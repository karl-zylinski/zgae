### IMPORTANT ###

- make dynamic array always push a dummy object if empty on first push... maybe? is it bad? yes, probably, when you count manually added objects everything will be off

- stop using strings, keep only hashes!

- do... the physics properly

### LESS IMPORTANT ###

- make da_insert prettier

- put renderer on own thread

- alpha support (something else than VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR)

- rewrite obj loader, its ugly

- make renderer askable about source type, i.e. have shader_default_fragment as source string, and append whatever renderer tells us to do... or maybe just have a source_spirv field and ask renderer which field to pull, like with a SHADER_LANGAUGE_TYPE enum in the renderer

- in shader in parser, error if > 1 shader of a type

- add library shader compiler or invoke commandline shader compiler (so we can use glsl)

- make resource that is compiled into just a struct and then loaded quickly (data compiler)
